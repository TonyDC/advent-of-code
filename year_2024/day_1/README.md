# Day 1

## Part 1

To determine the final value, two lists are created, one for each column. Values in a given column are added to their respective list. After sorting the lists, the values are then subtracted and the differences are added together.

## Part 2

Each distinct value from the second column is counted, and then multiplied by their value in order to get the sum. Finally, the sum is multiplied by the value of the first column.
